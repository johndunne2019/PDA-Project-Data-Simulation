    "of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data\n",
    "related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",
    "We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could\n",
    "collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their\n",
    "relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the\n",

    "    * Within Permutations there are 2 functions shuffle and permutation.The shuffle function is used to shuffle the contents of an array. In other words change the order of an array of numbers. The permutation function randomly permutes a range when given a single argument. So for example if the user enters the argument 15 in numpy.random.permutation a range of 0:14 is permuted in a random order.\n",

However, machines are deterministic and they cannot therefore generate true random nondeterministic numbers. Pseudo Random Number Generator(PRNG) is an algorithm used to generate sequences of random numbers. \n"
