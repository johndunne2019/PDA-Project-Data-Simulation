# PDA-Project-Data-Simulation
My project submission for the module Programming for Data Analysis

## Problem statement
For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project you should:

• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.

• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

## Project Plan
**The following are the steps I will take:**
* Investigate possible real-world phenomenons to use to create a data set. 
* When I have identified a real-world phenomenon of interest to me I will research in order to pick the variables that are of most interest to me.
* I will ensure that at least 100 data points across at least 4 variables could be collected when dealing this real-world phenomenon 
* When I have picked the variables I would like to synthesise in the data set simulation I will research the properties of these varibales, their likely distributions and their relationships with each other.
* Use numpy.random to synthesise a data set matching these properties that I have identified as closely as possible. 
* Detail the research in this jupyter notebook and display the simulated data in an output cell within this notebook.
